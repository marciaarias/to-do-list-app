This To-do List app has been developed on Java, utilizing the Swing library. It features a main window where, through a connection to a MySQL server database, the user can visualize all the tasks previously added.

Upon clicking on a task from the table, the "Manage Task" section will get populated with its data, allowing the user to Delete, Update or Add new tasks; the user can also check if the current task has already been completed.

On the upper-right corner of the main window, there is a "?" (Help) button which contains a brief description of the app and how to use it.
